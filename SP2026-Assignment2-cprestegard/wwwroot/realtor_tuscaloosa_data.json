Buyer must obtain a pre-qualification letter from a lender of their choice. If buyer intends to pay with cash, a bank letter or other financial account statement showing proof of sufficient funds to cover 100% of the purchase price will be required (account numbers should be removed or redacted). Buyer understands and agrees to submit said documentation to auctioneer within 24 hours of the auction. Occupation and Utilities Disclosure. To the best of Seller's knowledge, the property is vacant.

Buyer should conduct their own investigation and satisfy that the size and/or square footage, acreage, and bedroom/bathroom count of the dwelling/building is acceptable to the Buyer prior to placing any bid or offer on a property. By placing a bid or offer on a property, Buyer is accepting the property in as-is where-is condition and agrees to be bound to the bid or offer should a discrepancy arise.",

    "Description": "The Watermelon Road Tract is a 129 +/- acre parcel in Tuscaloosa County that would be ideal for a recreational buyer. Located only 5 miles from the North River Yacht Club and 15 miles from downtown Tuscaloosa. This property provides multiple opportunities for recreational and financial benefit. Additionally, as development and infrastructure improvements expand closer and closer to this area, property values are appreciating quickly. Upon arrival, you will find nearly 500 yards of paved road frontage with utilities along Watermelon Road, a gated entrance, and a great internal road system. With some dirt work, you could make a home or campsite. There is a one food plot with a hunting house in a secluded location on the south side of the property. There are a few other smaller areas that are planted for hunting deer and turkey alongside the roads and trails. For hunters, you'll want to key in on some of the white oaks along the hardwood SMZs as well. The current owners also enjoy letting their kids ride the trails on 4-wheelers. The sellers own the mineral rights and they will convey with the sale. This property is covered in gravel and the current owners have created a rock pit and sold off rock to the city previously. This could possibly be continued as an on-going revenue stream or canceled if desired. There is one coal well on the property too. Majority of the timber on the property is around 15 year old natural pine and hardwood regeneration with mature hardwood smz and seasonal streams running through the property. There is an easement in place for the coal well company through the property and to the neighbors. They maintain the roads with minimal disturbance to the property.
